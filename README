Compiler Documentation

To run the compiler, run `exec.sh <input file>`.
exec.sh may need to be chmodded first. To chmod the scripts, just run the
command `source build.sh`

##################################
build.sh
To run for the first time, need to run `source build.sh`
This script chmods build.sh and exec.sh to make them executable.

##################################
exec.sh
Calls python3 and passes compiler.py (in a directory above) and any other 
command line arguments.

##################################
compiler.py
Main file for the compiler.
Expects a single command line argument which is the file to be compiled.
Calls scanner.py

##################################
scanner.py
Takes a file and base name as input.
Produces a file named with the base name and of the type tok.

lexer(inputFile, baseName)
Opens or creates the file <baseName>.tok
Reads the inputFile line by line and processes the tokens.

processToken(tok, lineNumber, output)
takes in a token, line number, and output file as input.
Processes a token and determines if it is valid.
Prints to stdout if there was an invalid token. Prints the line number and
possible cause.

findSubTok(tok, subStringLength, output)
Takes a token, length of a substring, and output file as input.
Checks the substring of a token for a valid token. 
If a valid substring token is found, then the substring will be written 
to the output file as a token and the part of the token that isn't in the
substring is checked to see if it's a valid token.

validToken(tok, output)
Takes a token and output file as input.
Checks if the token is valid according to TL 16 specs.
If the token is valid, then the token is written to the output file.
Returns a boolean value based on if the token is valid or not.

ParseRv5.py

Class Parser: 
	Wrapper class containing the main imperative processing of the parser. Calls static helper classes for grammar verification and AST synthesis. Makes use of Node and ASTree objects.

ASTree.py
Class ASTree:
	A single ASTree object is used to represent the Abstract Syntax Tree, also contains a helper method for type checking and GraphViz generation.

Node.py
Class Node:
	A Node object represents a single node in the AST and contains all necessary information for AST synthesis and type checking.

SyntaxChecker.py
Class Checker:
	Contains static methods used to check the syntax of various grammar elements.

AstBuilder.py
Class Builder:
	Contains static methods used in AST synthesis. Static methods assume that the input token stream is syntactically valid.

codeGeneration.py

generate_code(ast, base_name)
Takes in an AST and the base name of the tl file. 
Produces a CFG and MIPS source file.
Calls three_code_gen(ast) which will take an ast and generate a block structure.


A block is a structure which has a pointer for entryBlock, thenBlock, and elseBlock.
Each block also has a label (composed of Block + its number) and a list of its instructions.

Code generation is a two-part recursive method, three_code_walk_ast(block, ast, parent='program', symTable = None).
When the method is called, the ast node will call the same method and pass its children as a parameter.
The method checks the children before calling the recursive method to see if more blocks will need to be created. All of the blocks and most of the connections are done at this stage.

Once a node has called all its children with the recursive method, it will handle the current ast node.
The current node will take lists of returned strings from its children and combine it into one list, unless the node is a stmt list, if, or while. These nodes will pack all the instructions it has been given into its current block.
Once this phase is down, the block structure will have all of the MIPS instructions.
